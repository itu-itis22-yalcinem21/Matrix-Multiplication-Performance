# Matrix Multiplication on CPU and GPU

This project compares the performance of matrix multiplication under different parallelization approaches and hardware:

- **Single-threaded CPU** (baseline).
- **Multi-threaded CPU** (OpenMP/pthreads).
- **GPU** (CUDA).

We will measure and analyze execution times for various matrix sizes, illustrating how CPUs and GPUs handle parallel workloads differently.

## Project Proposal

See **Project-Proposal.pdf** for the background, objectives, and timeline.

## Future Steps

- Implement a CPU version (single and multi-thread).
- Implement a GPU version using CUDA.
- Collect benchmarking data (execution times, speedups, etc.).
- Document findings in a final report, along with performance comparisons.

## Repository Contents

- **Project-Proposal.pdf** – The project plan and timeline.
- **README.md** – This overview file.

(Additional files and code will be added as the project progresses.)
